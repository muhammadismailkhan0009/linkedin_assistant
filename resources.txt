this repo is goldmine because it tells us way to build urls from posts themselves:
use "data-urn" value of each post in this url format:
https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/${data-urn-value}

- the only downsize is that this method is not to be used for mass scrapping cuz
otherwise it may result in account blocks. so, use it sparangly and with delays.
ideal usecase is to extract profile posts and stay up-to-date.
